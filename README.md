# rust-coding-interview-prep

> 🦀 A curated collection of coding interview questions and data structures implemented in **Rust**.

This repository is dedicated to helping developers prepare for coding interviews using the Rust programming language. It covers a wide range of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving patterns commonly asked in technical interviews at top tech companies.

## 📌 Why Rust?

Rust is known for its safety, performance, and concurrency. Practicing DSA in Rust strengthens your understanding of memory management, ownership, and low-level system behavior—all while preparing for real-world software engineering interviews.
